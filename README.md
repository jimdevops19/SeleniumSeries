# Updated booking.com bot

Jim from JimShapedCoding made this as an example for his Selenium tutorials
(featured on FreeCodeCamp's YT channel). The bot no longer works,
so I decided to fork and update it. This fork only features the final iteration
of the project.

## ISSUES AND LIMITATIONS

1. I skipped selecting currency and no. of people altogether.

Booking.com seems to have some terrible, unstable locators - not sure if it
was better two years ago, but now some elements seem impossible to navigate
